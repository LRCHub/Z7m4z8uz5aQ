# Hi-STANDARD – STAY GOLD

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
my life is a normal life
working day today
no one knows my broken dream
I forgot it long ago
I tried to live a fantasy
I was just too young
In those days you were with me
the memory makes me smile
I won't forget
when you said to me "stay gold"
I won't forget
always in my heart "stay gold"
it was such a lonely time
after you were gone
you left me so suddenly
that was how you showed
your love
now I see the real meaning
of your words
they showed me the way to laugh
though your way was awkward
I won't forget
when you said to me "stay gold"
I won't forget
always in my heart "stay gold"
I won't forget
when you said to me "stay gold"
I won't forget
always in my heart "stay gold"
I won't forget I won't forget
always in my heart "stay gold"
